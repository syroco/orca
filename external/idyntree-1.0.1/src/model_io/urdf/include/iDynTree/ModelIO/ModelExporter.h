/**
 * \ingroup iDynTreeModelIO
 *
 * Helper class to export a model to the supported textual formats.
 *
 * Currently the only format supported for export is the URDF format,
 * as it is described in http://wiki.ros.org/urdf/XML .
 *
 * Only iDynTree::Model classes that represent multibody system with no loops
 * can be exported.
 *
 * Furthermore, currently the model exporter only exports a subset of the features
 * supported in iDynTree::Model. In particular, the following features are not exported:
 *
 * * Sensors
 * * Joint limits, damping and static friction.
 *
 * # Format documentation
 *
 * The following format are  supported  by the exporter.
 *
 * | Format | Extendend Name | Website |  String for filetype argument  |
 * |:-----------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|
 * | URDF | Unified Robot Description Format  | http://wiki.ros.org/urdf | `urdf` |
 *
 * ## URDF
 *
 * As the URDF format does not distinguish between frames and links (see https://discourse.ros.org/t/urdf-ng-link-and-frame-concepts/56
 * for an extensive discussion on this) the URDF model exporter converts iDynTree's *additional frames* to mass-less and shape-less
 * *fake* URDF links that are connected as child links via `fixed` joints to the corresponding **real** URDF links.
 *
 * Furthermore, it is widespread use in URDF models to never use a real link (with mass) as the root link of a model, mainly
 * due to workaround a bug in official %KDL parser used in ROS (see https://github.com/ros/kdl_parser/issues/27 for more info). For this reason,
 * if the selected base_link has at least one additional frame, by default the first additional frame of the base link is added as a **parent** fake URDF link,
 * instead as a **child** fake URDF link as done with the rest of %iDynTree's additional frames. If no additional frame is available for the base link,
 * the base link of the URDF will have a mass, and will generate a warning then used with the ROS's [`kdl_parser`](https://github.com/ros/kdl_parser) .
 * This behaviour can be disabled by setting to false the `exportFirstBaseLinkAdditionalFrameAsFakeURDFBase` attribute of ModelExporterOptions.
