# fpconv ( https://github.com/night-shift/fpconv ) is a small implementation of a shortest exact representation of double to string
# as of C++14, it has no equivalent in the C++ standaard, as using stringstream with setprecision(17) result
# in printing long numbers (such as 1.000000000000000000000) even when there is a short equivalent representation (1.0)
# This can be removed once std::to_chars from the charconv header introduced in C++17 becomes widely available
# We imported the MIT-licensed source code from https://github.com/night-shift/fpconv/tree/4a087d1b2df765baa409536931916a2c082cdda4
