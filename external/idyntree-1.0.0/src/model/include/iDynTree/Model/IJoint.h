     * Interface (i.e. abstract class) exposed by classes that implement a Joint.
     * A Joint is the basic representation of the motion allowed between two links.
     *
     * This interface is mean to be used by kinematics and dynamics algorithm to
     * query informations related to a joint and the relations (relative position,
     * relative twist, relative acceleration) that it imposes to the connected links.
     *
     * The design of this class is heavily inspired by the Simbody implementation of joints,
     * as described in this article:
     *
     * Seth, Ajay, et al. "Minimal formulation of joint motion for biomechanisms."
     * Nonlinear dynamics 62.1-2 (2010): 291-303.
     *
     * Other sources of inspiration are RBDL, DART and Featherstone book.
     *
     * With respect to all this implementation we model the joints as undirected quantities,
     * i.e. as object in which information can be queryied in symmetric way with respect to the
     * attached links. This mean there is no parent and child link, but the joint is attached
     * to two link, and the interface is agnostic with respect to which link the code considers
     * as "parent" or "child".
