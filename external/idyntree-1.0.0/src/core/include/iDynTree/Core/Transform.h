     *
     * This class is designed to be an easy to use proxy to perform change of frame of
     * expression for iDynTree::Position, iDynTree::Twist, iDynTree::Wrench and other data
     * structure in \ref iDynTreeCore.  For this reason the class is called "Transform", because it will be mainly
     * used to transform quantities between frames.
     *
     * Given that this class it may used to represent homogeneous transform matrix as well as adjoint
     * matrix, no raw access to the underline storage ( data() method ) is provided, because it does not
     * have a canonical representation. Instead, access is given to the two elements of a transform:
     *  The position vector \f${}^{\texttt{refOrient}} p_{\texttt{refPoint},\texttt{point}}\f$ and
     * the rotation matrix \f${}^{\texttt{refOrient}} R_{\texttt{orient}}\f$.
     *
     * We will indicate this tranform as \f$( {}^{\texttt{refOrient}} p_{\texttt{refPoint},\texttt{point}} , {}^{\texttt{refOrient}} R_{\texttt{orient}} )\f$
     *
     * The frame whose origin is the reference point and whose orientation the reference orientation is often
     * indicated as \f$ \texttt{refFrame} = (\texttt{refPoint},\texttt{refOrient}) \f$.
     *
     * Similarly the frame whose origin is the point and whose orientation is the orientation is indicated
     * as \f$ \texttt{frame} = (\texttt{point},\texttt{orient}) \f$.
     *
     * This transform object can be obtained as the \f${}^{\texttt{refFrame}} H_{\texttt{frame}}\f$  4x4 homogeneous matrix
     * using the asHomogeneousTransform method, or as the \f${}^{\texttt{refFrame}} X_{\texttt{frame}}\f$ 6x6 adjoint matrix using the
     * asAdjointTransform .
