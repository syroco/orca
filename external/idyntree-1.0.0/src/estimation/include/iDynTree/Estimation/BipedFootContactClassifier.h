   /* Foot Contact Classifier class for determining the primary foot in contact
    * with the ground surface. Contains contact state machines for each foot: left and right,
    * and implements the Schmitt Trigger thresholding on each foot to determine the primary
    * foot which is in contact according to a switching pattern criteria. 
    * The switching pattern is primarily used to change the frames of reference for the Legged Odometry (LO) 
    * while one of the two foot breaks contact with the ground surface, since LO assumes that atleast one
    * foot is in contact with ground at any instant of time. However, it is also used to assign 
    * the primary foot in case of double stance.
    * 
    * In the current version of this class, switching logic is implemented only for 
    * ALTERNATE_CONTACT patterns vastly considered during walking tasks. This class is aimed
    * to be extended towards other switching patterns like LATEST_ACTIVE_CONTACT, DEFAULT_CONTACT
    * for implementation along side different task based controllers.
