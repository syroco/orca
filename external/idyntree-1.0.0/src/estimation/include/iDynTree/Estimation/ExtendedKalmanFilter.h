     * @class DiscreteExtendedKalmanFilterHelper naive base class implementation of discrete EKF with additive Gaussian noise
     *
     * @warning This class is not stand-alone but can be used meaningfully only by classes deriving from it.
     * The system propagation function f() and measurement model function h() are virtual functions to be defined by
     * the derived class implementing the EKF.
     * Similarly, the Jacobians for the linearized system propagation and measurement model are also virtual functions
     * to be implemented by the derived class.
     *
     * The derived class must must set the size for states, inputs and outputs using ekfSetStateSize(), ekfSetInputSize() and ekfSetOutputSize() methods.
     * Then the derived class must call ekfInit() to resize the vectors and matrices for the EKF.
     *
     * Similarly before running the estimator through a loop, it is recommended to set the initial states and variances for measurements, system dynamics and intial states.
     * This is necessary to avoid any NaN values to be propagated.
     *
     * Once, initialized properly, the filter can be run by
     *  - calling ekfSetInputVector() to set the control inputs and then calling ekfPredict() at each prediction step, and
     *  - calling ekfSetMeasurementVector() to set the measurements and then calling ekfUpdate() at each update step
     *
     * The internal state of the estimator can be obtained by calling ekfGetStates().
     *
     * The Discrete Extended Kalman Filter equations implemented in this class are coherent with the ones described in
     * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Kalman_filter">Discrete-time predict and update equations section of this article.</a>
     *
     * The general workflow implementing/inheriting this class would be in the order,
     * - call ekfSetInputSize(), ekfSetOutputSize(), ekfSetStateSize() methods
     * - call ekfInit()
     * - call ekfSetInitialState(), ekfSetStateCovariance() (either done externally later or internally. usually done externally later, however, filter runs properly only if this step is done)
     * - call ekfSetSystemNoiseCovariance(), ekfSetMeasurementNoiseCovariance()
     *
     *   once this is setup,
     * - in a loop
     *     - call ekfSetInputVector() then ekfPredict(). Calling ekfGetStates() and ekfGetStateCovariance() at this point will give us the predicted states and its covariance
     *     - call ekfSetMeasurementVector() then ekfUpdate(). Calling ekfGetStates() and ekfGetStateCovariance() at this point will give us the updated states and its covariance
     * @note if we intend to change the state size, input size or output size on the fly, it is crucial to call the ekfInit() method again, since this resizes the buffers accordingly
     *       failing to do so will result in memory leaks and will cause the program to crash.
